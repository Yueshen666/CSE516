% this .m file contains your defined pca function.% The function takes the data matrix X and the number of components k to keep;% The output of the function should be the reduced data matrix Zfunction Z = simple_pca(X, k)  % your code here  % step 1. normalization    mu = mean(X)  X = X - mu    % step 2. derive covariance matrix  [ m, n ] = size(X)  C = 1/m * X' * X  % step 3. get U, S, V using eig  [ V, D, W] = eig(C)    % step 4. get reduced_U and Z  reduced_U = V(:, 1:k)  Z = X* reduced_U    % end of code end
